            A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. This is true both literally 
            and metaphorically for the founder of the company &apos;The Divine Hands&apos;. Akansha started 
            with her travel diaries in the year 2011 and has had the fortune of not just visiting 
            but living and experiencing at length the culture and ethos of various geographies 
            including UAE, US and UK. Experience being the biggest teacher, she learned a plethora 
            of things during this venture of hers and this learning prompted her to embark on 
            another venture of hers.

            Homemade and healthier food products are the most coveted both in/outside India but 
            due to the extreme rarity of such options, people don&apos;t have access to this variety. 
            Driven by her love for food and her supply-demand deficit comprehension, Akansha 
            decided to bridge this gap through her platform. This platform celebrates home chefs, 
            their creativity and culture. Akansha being a strong believer of the fact that &apos;Food 
            is the ultimate love language&apos;- she is starting with serving India but wants to export 
            the flavours and nostalgia of homemade food products to other countries as well.

            She has taken the first step and is already looking forward to the journey that God 
            willing, will not just entail a thousand miles but will eventually be boundless
